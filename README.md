# Watch

Watch is a modern, immersive video feed app, built with Next.js inside the world App. The app integrates World ID verification using MiniKit, features a full-screen, snap-scrolling video feed with variable rewards per video, and a profile page that shows user metrics and an interactive earnings graph.

## Features

- **World ID Verification:**
  Users must verify their identity with World ID before accessing the video feed.

- **Immersive Video Feed:**
  Full-screen videos with snap-scrolling behavior. Each video has its own custom reward, which users can claim after watching.

- **Interactive Profile Page:**
  View your total earnings, videos watched, rewards claimed, and an interactive graph of earnings per video.

- **Modern UI:**
  Sleek, futuristic design with a gradient background and animated elements.
